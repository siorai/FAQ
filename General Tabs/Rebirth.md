# Rebirth
### What is Rebirth
As you make it farther in a run you may notice progress starts to slow down.
Panels get more expensive and you might not be earning enough to keep up
with the increasing costs.

### Resetting
Rebirthing helps with this by cashing in all your profit you've earned through that run
and resets all your panel levels in exchange for units.

### Units
Units are essential for breaking any progress walls you hit.
These units individually each provide a 1*% global profit boost and also can be spent permanently for new abilities.
So striking a balance between purchasing new abilities and keeping enough units for your global buff is crucial.
The total boost from your units is directly determined by your boost per unit (or BPU for short).
\* the 1% is multiplied by your unit boost

### Boost Per Unit (BPU)
Boost per unit is the amount your profit is increased for each unit.
It starts out at +1% per unit and can be increased in various ways.
You can see your boost per unit from the rebirth screen.
