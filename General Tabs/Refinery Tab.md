# Refinery
Each different refinery provides a different type of buff. 
The first 3 refineries work with your Panels, providing profit bonus, cost decrease, and speed increase.
Make sure you select them in the 'Allocate menu'.
Each successful run of the refinery on a particular panel will increase the amount of time required to refine it again. 
Note that new panels unlocked are NOT automatically allocated. 
The 4th and 5th refineries deal with units and credits and are explained by clicking on them. 
Later game you can unlock an ability called "Optimize Allocation".
This automatically makes allocation trend towards all being of equal level.
