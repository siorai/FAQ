# Ability Deck
On the ability deck page you can spend your pool of AP to mix and match the abilities you would like to use. 
At the top of this page you have the option to purchase new abilities using units. 
Units are a 3rd currency gained from rebirthing.
As you purchase more copies of the same abilities, they are recorded as XP.
This is how you upgrade Enhanceable.
