| Chest Reward Boost | increases chest profit rewards by +3% per level | ⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ | Chests give about 5 mins worth of profit so can be good |
| Chest Spawn Delay | decreases chest wave spawn delay by -5% per level | ⭐⬛⬛⬛⬛ | Chests spawn fast enough already |
| Chest Rarity Rate |increases chest rarity by +3% per level | ⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ | Need 400 Perks to go up 1 rarity, At some point your upgrades will do this for you |

| Equip Tier | increases equipment tier by +0.7 per level | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | By far the best perk, basically a *10 to all boosts |
| Fabrication | decreases fabrication time by -1% per level | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Modules are the best late game... So more = better |
